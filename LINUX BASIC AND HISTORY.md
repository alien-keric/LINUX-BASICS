In the world of hacking and security we need to understand different things before we start digging deeper in hacking.

Lets start with a hacker(who is a hacker?):


In short, a hacker is an individual who uses their programming and computer skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks with the intent of understanding, exploiting, or bypassing security measures.

NB:
It's important to note that the term "hacker" has different connotations, and not all hackers engage in malicious activities. Some hackers, known as "white hat" or "ethical hackers," use their skills to identify and fix security vulnerabilities to improve overall system security.
```

```
TYPES OF HACKERS

1. white hacker 
These are hackers with the intention of inhencing security of either an organization or system, Normally know as ethical hackers

2. black hacker (bad hackers)
This is a hacker with the intention of doing malicous activities such as doing crimes either online or offline

3. Grey hackers
- Grey hat hackers fall somewhere between black hat and white hat hackers.
- They may hack without authorization but with good intentions, often notifying the target about the vulnerabilities after the fact.

4.  and so on
```

```
In order to be a hacker doesn't matter your a black or white hacker your need skills, and these skills are:-

1. computer basics
2. operating system(unix and windows)
3. networking
4. linux fundamentals and windows fundamentals
5. programming language(most bash,python, java ,php and so on)
6. security tools
7. consistency in hacking 
```


## ABOUT LINUX 
```
What is Linux?

In short, Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It serves as the basis for various operating systems known as Linux distributions

Why hackers prefers linux:
hacker prefers linux because
1. open source
2. security
3. stable
4. Distro(varius distributions such as kali linux,ubuntu,fedora,parrot,Debian and so on)
5. Multiplatform
6. package management and so on
```


## Kali Linux  installation
```
with installation we will talk about kali linux.Installation of kali linux is very simple.

Ways you can install kali linux:-
1. virtual box (suitable for windows user and linux users too)
2. dual boot 
3. vmware (most suitable for windows users incase)

For more installation you can just visit kali.org site there is a quick guide on how to install kali linux
```



## INTRODUCTION TO LINUX OS
```
In this module, we will cover:

- Linux structure
- Using the shell
- Navigating the Linux operating system
- Working with files and directories
- Linux administration
- Service management
- Permissions management


```

## LINUX STRUCTURE
```
the structure is the basic of everything on linux

The following is the linux file  hierarchy

- /dev (Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.)

- /etc (Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.)

- /lib (Shared library files that are required for system boot.)

- /media (External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.)

- /mnt (Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.)

- /opt (Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.)

- /sbin (This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).)

- /tmp (The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.)

- /usr (Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc)

- /var (This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.)

- /root (The home directory for the root user.)
```

#### Linux Commands
```
As a hacker you probably need to know how to interact with command line i.e terminal or cmd or powershell.

In linux everything is a files  
```

## Introduction to shell
```
A Linux terminal, also called a `shell` or command line, provides a text-based input/output (I/O) interface between users and the kernel for a computer system. The term console is also typical but does not refer to a window but a screen in text mode. In the terminal window, commands can be executed to control the system

Besides Bash, there also exist other shells like zsh,ksh and so on
